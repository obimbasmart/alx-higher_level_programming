Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each
of these characters: ., ? and :

- Prototype: def text_indentation(text):
- text must be a string, otherwise raise a TypeError
    exception with the message text must be a string
- There should be no space at the beginning or at the end of each printed line
- You are not allowed to import any module

first import the function:
        >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

check for normal string without seperators:
		>>> text = "Holberton School"
		>>> text_indentation(text)
		Holberton School
		>>> text = ""
		>>> text_indentation(text)

check for string with ., ? and:
        >>> text = "Obimba Smart: went to ? . his brother bright"
        >>> text_indentation(text)
        Obimba Smart
        <BLANKLINE>
        went to 
        <BLANKLINE>
        <BLANKLINE>
        <BLANKLINE>
        his brother bright

check for non string arg:
        >> text_indentation(32)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        TypeError: text must be a string

check for empty string:
        >>> text_indentation("")

check for arg without delimeters:
        >>> text_indentation("My name is obimba smart")
        My name is obimba smart
