jQuery simplifies front-end development by providing a concise and powerful set of tools for interacting with the DOM, handling events, and making AJAX requests. Its syntax is designed to be user-friendly and significantly reduces the amount of code needed for common tasks.

In this project, I have learnt a handful of jQuery syntax and applied them to solve real-world simple problems:

- How to modify an HTML element style
- How to get and update an `HTML` element content
- How to modify the DOM
- How to make a `GET` request with `JQuery Ajax`
- How to make a `POST` request with JQuery Ajax
- How to listen/bind to `DOM` events
